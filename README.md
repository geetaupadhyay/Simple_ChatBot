# HI! I'm NeuralBot. 
Chatbot using Python and Tkinter
<h4> Feel Free to read if you want to know a little something about me</h4>

<h1>1. Python (This Language is the reason i am who i am today)</h1>
-->Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

<h1>Tools Used(My most favourite supporting characters): </h1>
<li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
<li>Tkinter</li>

<h1>Jupyter Notebook(It was fun being in here, it's so easy to communicate with!, like me)</h1>
-->The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.
Jupyter Notebooks are a spin-off project from the IPython project, which used to have an IPython Notebook project itself. The name, Jupyter, comes from the core supported programming languages that it supports: Julia, Python, and R. Jupyter ships with the IPython kernel, which allows you to write your programs in Python, but there are currently over 100 other kernels that you can also use.

<h1>Tkinter(if i am presentable today, it's only because of Tkinter.)</h1>
-->Tkinter is a GUI(Graphical User Interface) method offered by Python and is most commonly used. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.
